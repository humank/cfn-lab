Description: >
    This template contains the security groups required by our entire stack.
    We create them in a seperate nested template, so they can be referenced
    by all of the other nested templates.

Parameters:
    
    EnvironmentName:
        Description: An environment name that will be prefixed to resource names
        Type: String
    
    VPC:
        Type: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id
        Description: Choose which VPC the security groups should be deployed to

Resources:

    # This security group defines who/where is allowed to access the EC2 hosts directly.
